          <h1>Beef Bourguignon</h1>
          <div class="pad-right-2">
            <p>Boeuf bourguignon (French for Burgundy beef) is a well known, traditional French stew prepared with beef braised
              in red wine (originally Burgundy wine) and beef broth, flavored with garlic, onions, carrots, a bouquet garni
              and garnished with mushrooms. Formerly, chefs larded the meat with lardons, but modern beef is so tender and
              well marbled that this time-consuming technique is rarely necessary. Julia Child included a recipe for Sauté
              de Boeuf à la Bourguignonne in Mastering the Art of French Cooking, her famous first book. Child recommends
              serving this dish "in a casserole, or on a platter surrounded with steamed rice, risotto, or potato balls sautéed
              in butter", and also states that "buttered green peas or beans could accompany it, and a good red Bordeaux
              wine". She also points out that this is a dish that benefits from a day in the refrigerator.</p>

        <ol class="list-padding">
          <li>Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F. </li>
          <li>Heat the olive oil in a large Dutch oven. Add the bacon and cook over medium heat for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally,
            until the bacon is lightly browned. Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon to a large plate. </li>
          <li>Dry the beef cubes with paper towels and then sprinkle them with salt and pepper. In batches in single layers,
            sear the beef in the hot oil for 3 to 5 minutes, turning to brown on all sides. Remove the seared cubes to the
            plate with the bacon and continue searing until all the beef is browned. Set aside. </li>
          <li>Toss the carrots, and onions, 1 tablespoon of salt and 2 teaspoons of pepper in the fat in the pan and cook for
            10 to 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the onions are lightly browned. Add the garlic and cook for 1
            more minute. Add the Cognac, stand back, and ignite with a match to burn off the alcohol.</li>
          <li>Put the meat and bacon back into the pot with the juices. Add the bottle of wine plus enough beef broth to almost
            cover the meat. Add the tomato paste and thyme. Bring to a simmer, cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid and
            place it in the oven for about 1 1/4 hours or until the meat and vegetables are very tender when pierced with
            a fork.
          </li>
          <li>Combine 2 tablespoons of butter and the flour with a fork and stir into the stew. Add the frozen onions. Saute
            the mushrooms in 2 tablespoons of butter for 10 minutes until lightly browned and then add to the stew. Bring
            the stew to a boil on top of the stove, then lower the heat and simmer for 15 minutes. Season to taste. </li>
          <li>To serve, toast the bread in the toaster or oven. Rub each slice on 1 side with a cut clove of garlic. For each
            serving, spoon the stew over a slice of bread and sprinkle with parsley. </li>
