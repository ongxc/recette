      <div class="pad-right-2">
        <p>A charlotte is a type of dessert or trifle that can be served hot or cold. It can also be known as an "ice-box cake".
          Bread, sponge cake or biscuits/cookies are used to line a mold, which is then filled with a fruit puree or custard.
          It can also be made using layers of breadcrumbs. Classically, stale bread dipped in butter was used as the lining,
          but sponge cake or ladyfingers may be used today. The filling may be covered with a thin layer of similarly flavoured
          gelatin.

    <ol class="list-padding">
      <li>Soften the gelatin in a bowl with the water. Pour in the milk and completely dissolve the gelatin. Let it sit while
        you prepare rest of filling, stirring it every now and again to keep gelatin from separating and settling to bottom.
      </li>
      <li>Sweeten 2 cups of the cream with 1 cup of the sugar and beat it with a handheld electric mixer until it is fairly stiff.
        Add vanilla and fold it in. Stir in dissolved gelatin and gently but thoroughly fold it into whipped cream and set
        it aside. </li>
      <li>Cut cake into ladyfinger-sized pieces, about 1/2-inch thick by 1-inch wide and as long as your mold is deep. Line bottom
        and sides of a 3-quart mold or bowl with cake, being sure that there are no gaps in it. Hold back enough cake to
        cover top of mold or bowl. Sprinkle cake with sherry and spread it with a thin layer of jam or fruit preserves, if
        using. </li>
      <li>Beat egg whites to stiff but not dry peaks with a handheld electric mixer, then fold thoroughly into whipped cream
        and gelatin filling. Spoon filling into cake-lined mold, making sure there are no gaps or air pockets between filling
        and cake. Press reserved cake on top of filling. </li>
      <li>Chill until cream is set, 4 to 6 hours. When you are ready to serve, gently run a knife around edges of mold to make
        sure that the Charlotte has not stuck to it, then invert onto plate. Carefully lift off mold. </li>
      <li>Lightly sweeten remaining 1 cup cream with remaining 1/4 cup sugar and beat until it is stiff. If you like, you can
        put it into a pastry bag and pipe it onto the Charlotte, or simply spoon it on, using it to cover any gaps or splits
        in outer layer of cake. Garnish with fresh fruit. </li>
    </ol>
